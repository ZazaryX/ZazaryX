**4. My favorite hobby is** `Programming`

**5. My primary programming language is** `C#`

> **VoidForge**  
> In this Unity project, my character (Zazary) will wield a sword, and the gameplay will be similar to soul-like games.

**8. What frameworks and tools do I use?**

   - **Frameworks**: Web Selenium C#, memory.dll C#
   - **Development Environment**: Visual Studio

**9. What tools do I use for reverse engineering?**

   - **Tools**: Cheat Engine for games, IDA Pro for programs
   - **What I've done**: I’ve hacked games using Cheat Engine, such as RimWorld, Watch Dogs Legion, Far Cry 6, Satisfactory, etc. I also wrote mini-scripts in Assembly for Cheat Engine and created trainers (e.g., infinite items, Fly mode) using memory.dll. Additionally, I’ve hacked programs using IDA Pro, including gaining access to my own custom-made software.

>I also do modeling in Blender. You can see my animation in the form of a `GIF with my character` (I will rework it for the game in the future). I started learning Blender about 6 months ago.
