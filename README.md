>Altercell - what can I say about it
>>Altercell initially was called `A bug game` and the gameplay was such that the player had to complete tasks from the blue skull, its name **(Developer)**, but I changed my mind about the `gameplay and decided it will be a game about programming and hacking like in Watch Dogs 2`, `the graphics will look = Low Poly`, `and add a Multiplayer in the release version.` Also, I want to implement `VR support in this game` (if I buy it)

>I also do modeling in Blender, you can see my animation in the form of a `gif with my character (I will rework it for the game in the future)`, I started learning it about 6 months ago ___`Interesting fact, I created my character for about 1 month`___
